As of release 3.7.7, gr-dvbs2 is now part of GNU Radio
in the gr-dtv component and the Digital Television
category of gnuradio-companion. However, for those
that prefer forking and developing in a OOT module,
all the changes in GNU Radio have been backported
to gr-dvbs2.

The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-S2
transmitter, based on the EN 302 307 V1.3.1 Second Generation
framing structure, channel coding and modulation systems for
Broadcasting, Interactive Services, New Gathering and other
broadband satellite applications standard:

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302300_302399/302307/01.03.01_60/en_302307v010301p.pdf

The baseband framing, baseband scrambling, LDPC (low density
parity check), BCH (Bose, Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem), bit interleaver
and physical layer framing and scrambling blocks are from G4GUO's
DATV-Express Digital Amateur Television project datvexpress_gui
(https://github.com/G4GUO/datvexpress_gui/tree/master/DVB-S2)
and converted to GnuRadio 3.7.x.

A gnuradio-companion flowgraph (dvbs2_tx.grc) for the bladeRF
transmit capable SDR is included along with a stand-alone
Python script for bladeRF (dvbs2-blade.py).

A test Transport Stream that matches the example applications
symbol rate, constellation and code rate can be downloaded here:

A DVB-S2 and DVB-S2X Transport Stream bit-rate calculator:

https://github.com/drmpeg/dtv-utils/blob/master/dvbs2rate.c

Note: This implementation supports the following DVB-S2
System configurations:

1) QPSK 1/4, 1/3, 2/5
2) QPSK 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
3) 8PSK 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
4) 16APSK 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
5) 32APSK 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
6) CCM (Constant Coding and Modulation)
7) FECFRAME normal 64,800 bits
8) FECFRAME short 16,200 bits
9) Single Transport Stream
10) Roll-off 0.35, 0.25 and 0.20

System configurations not supported are:

1) VCM (Variable Coding and Modulation)
2) ACM (Adaptive Coding and Modulation)
3) Multiple Transport Streams
4) Single Generic Stream
5) Multiple Generic Streams
6) Input Stream Synchronizer
7) Null Packet Detection
8) Dummy Frame Insertion
9) Wide-band mode

Note: DVB-S2X Broadcast services MODCOD's have been tested
as of September 2016 with the Silicon Labs Si2183 demodulator.
VL-SNR modes have been implemented, but are still untested.
For DVB-S2X, optional Broadcast services configurations supported
are 64APSK and 64APSK-L. 128APSK, 256APSK and 256APSK-L
constellations are included for experimentation.
