Since the functionality of the CCM version of the DVB-S2 transmitter
is already included in GNU Radio, this OOT implements a VCM/ACM
(Variable/Adaptive Coding and Modulation) version of the DVB-S2
transmitter. A VCM/ACM capable DVB-GSE block and test flow graph
(dvbs2_txip.grc) are also included.

The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-S2
transmitter, based on the EN 302 307 V1.3.1 Second Generation
framing structure, channel coding and modulation systems for
Broadcasting, Interactive Services, New Gathering and other
broadband satellite applications standard:

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302300_302399/302307/01.03.01_60/en_302307v010301p.pdf

The baseband framing, baseband scrambling, LDPC (low density
parity check), BCH (Bose, Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem), bit interleaver
and physical layer framing and scrambling blocks are from G4GUO's
DATV-Express Digital Amateur Television project datvexpress_gui
(https://github.com/G4GUO/datvexpress_gui/tree/master/DVB-S2)
and converted to GnuRadio 3.7.x.

A gnuradio-companion flowgraph (dvbs2_tx.grc) for the bladeRF
and Ettus B2xx transmit capable SDR's is included.

A set of test Transport Streams that matches the example application
symbol rate, constellations and code rates can be downloaded here:

A DVB-S2 and DVB-S2X Transport Stream bit-rate calculator:

Note: This implementation supports the following DVB-S2
System configurations:

1) QPSK 1/4, 1/3, 2/5
2) QPSK 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
3) 8PSK 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
4) 16APSK 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
5) 32APSK 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10
6) CCM (Constant Coding and Modulation)
7) FECFRAME normal 64,800 bits
8) FECFRAME short 16,200 bits
9) Single Transport Stream
10) Roll-off 0.35, 0.25 and 0.20
11) VCM (Variable Coding and Modulation)
12) ACM (Adaptive Coding and Modulation)
13) Multiple Transport Streams
14) Multiple Generic Streams
15) Single Generic Stream
16) Dummy Frame Insertion

System configurations not supported are:

1) Input Stream Synchronizer
2) Null Packet Detection
3) Wide-band mode

Note: DVB-S2X Broadcast services MODCOD's have been tested
as of September 2016 with the Silicon Labs Si2183 demodulator.
VL-SNR modes have been implemented, but are still untested.
